# 🌾 Crop Recommendation System using Machine Learning

This project is a Machine Learning–based Crop Recommendation System that suggests the most suitable crop based on soil nutrients and climate conditions.

## 📌 Problem Statement
Farmers often select crops based on experience rather than data. This project helps in recommending the best crop using machine learning by analyzing soil and weather parameters.

## 🎯 Objective
To build a predictive model that recommends crops using:
- Soil nutrients (N, P, K)
- Temperature
- Humidity
- pH value
- Rainfall

## 🧠 Machine Learning Algorithm
- Random Forest Classifier

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset contains the following features:
- N (Nitrogen)
- P (Phosphorus)
- K (Potassium)
- Temperature (°C)
- Humidity (%)
- pH
- Rainfall (mm)
- Label (Crop Name)

Dataset file: `Crop_recommendation.csv`

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn

## ⚙️ How to Run the Project

### 1. Install required libraries
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
